        "During my time at NIT Rourkela, I dove into the world of technology and got myself a Bachelor's degree. But hey, it wasn't just about the degree. It was about the journey! Oh, and the friends I made they're not just pals, they're partners in crime... the creative kind, of course! Together, we're cooking up all sorts of stuff that's making life even more interesting. This whole NIT journey didn't just boost my tech skills; it polished me up as a person too. So yeah, NIT Rourkela you taught me tech, friendship, and a bit about being a better person.",

    title: "MemoApps - Flutter Developer Intern",
    description:
        "So, I jumped into the Flutter Developer Internship at MemoApps in the summer of 2023. Those were the days of innovation and coding excitement! I tapped into Firebase and Hive, working hand in hand with the rest of the development crew, we made sure those shiny new features slid into the app without a hitch. Tools of the trade? Flutter and Dart were my dynamic duo, while Firebase and Hive were my reliable steeds on this coding adventure. So, in those hot months of May to July, I dived deep into Flutter, crunched Dart, tamed databases, and came out the other end with a grin",

        "Alright, let's rewind to the end of 2020. That's when I hopped aboard the Google Student Developer Club. Now, what was this club all about? Well, they were dishing out some serious Android development knowledge at the time of joining, all wrapped up with a bow made of Kotlin. And you know what? I was all in. Learning Kotlin seemed like the path to tech glory. But, here's the twist: about halfway through, I had a lightbulb moment. Flutter started calling my name louder than a siren song. Fast forward a bit, and voila! Here I am, with my very own Flutter-powered website. And guess what? There's more goodness on the horizon. Cool updates are cooking up, so stay tuned.",

        "I found my way to Buildspace through a very close friend of mine (shoutout @abhishek_rp2002), Buildspace is a cool hub for developers and builders like me. The best part? No fancy prerequisites, just a free pass to an awesome community and e-learning playground. I teamed up with a buddy I crossed paths with on their Discord server (shoutout @ClarkAllen21). Together, we embarked on a journey fueled by a captivating idea and yes, we're crafting it with the Flutter magic. If you're scanning my portfolio and can't spot this project, don't fret. It's a work in progress. But hey, if you're eager to see where it's headed, my socials are the place to be. I'll be dishing out updates on the regular.",
